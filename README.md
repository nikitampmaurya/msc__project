Project Title: Understanding Uterine Fibroids from mechanisms to potential treatments Sep 2024 - Sep 2025

Description: Investigating biomarkers associated with fibroids and their subtypes in womenâ€™s myometrium tissues using bulk RNA-sequencing and identifying potential drug candidates through drug repurposing.

Objectives: 
1. Characterise differences between myometrium vs fibroids  

2. Identifying different types of fibroids  

3. Identify potential drug candidates for fibroids treatment

Methods:

Slide 4: Methods  

1. Data Preprocessing:  

Download and curate data  

Perform normalization and quality control (QC)  

Integrate data from different sources  

2. Analyses:  

a. Differential gene expression analysis and functional enrichment  

b. Clustering of fibroids and functional enrichment  

c. In-silico drug repurposing
