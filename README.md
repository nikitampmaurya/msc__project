## Project Title: Understanding Uterine Fibroids from mechanisms to potential treatments Sep 2024 - Sep 2025

## Description: 

Investigating biomarkers associated with fibroids and their subtypes in womenâ€™s myometrium tissues using bulk RNA-sequencing and identifying potential drug candidates through drug repurposing.

## Objectives: 
1. Characterise differences between myometrium vs fibroids  

2. Identifying different types of fibroids  

3. Identify potential drug candidates for fibroids treatment

## Methods: 
1. Data Preprocessing:  

Download and curate data  

Perform normalization and quality control (QC)  

Integrate data from different sources  

2. Analyses:  

a. Differential gene expression analysis and functional enrichment  

b. Clustering of fibroids and functional enrichment  

c. In-silico drug repurposing  

## Expected Results 
Identified genes associated with fibroids and their pathways and processes they are involved with. 

Identify fibroid sub-types based on molecular signatures 

Compile a list of promising drug candidates for fibroid treatment.
